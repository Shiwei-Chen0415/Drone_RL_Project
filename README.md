# Drone Navigation using LiDAR and SAC in Isaac Gym

**Project Overview**

This project implements a GPU-accelerated reinforcement learning system for drone navigation using NVIDIA Isaac Gym Preview 4 platform.
The drone learns to reach its goal while avoiding obstacles using 6-direction rotatable LiDAR sensing and the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.
